This is a **complete redesign** of the official website of **StarGlow Beaute**, created as a personal frontend project to improve my skills in UI/UX, layout design, and modern responsive web development. The design and layout were recreated and improved based on personal design choices, not copied pixel-by-pixel from the original.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is **not** the official website of StarGlow Beaute. This is a **self-made redesign** created for educational and portfolio purposes only. All brand assets, names, and images belong to their respective owners.

## ✨ Features

- Custom redesigned layout and user interface

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for structure
- **CSS3** – for layout and styling

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Applying design thinking to real brands
- Creating aesthetic and functional web layouts from scratch
- Mobile-first responsive development
- Improved CSS architecture and file structuring

## 📌 Note

This project is **not affiliated** with **StarGlow Beaute**. It’s a creative redesign meant to explore better user experience and showcase frontend development skills.
